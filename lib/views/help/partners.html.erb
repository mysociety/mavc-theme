 <h3>LIBERIA FREEDOM OF INFORMATION COALITION (LFIC)</h3> 
<p>The Liberia Freedom of Information Coalition (LFIC) was established by nine civil society organizations working to promote transparency and accountability, good governance and participatory democracy, human rights and rule of law, freedom of expression and media development, Peace Building and Conflict Management in 2013, as a successor to the Liberia Freedom of Expression Coalition. The LFIC through collaborative actions with the media drafted and campaigned for the passage of the FOI law, thus establishing the FOI regime in Liberia since 2010.</p>
 
<h5>PURPOSE/GOAL OF THE COALITION</h5>
<p>The purpose/ goal of the LFIC is to empower or reinforce the capacities of civil societies in Liberia and other partners involved with FOI/Right to information activities to promote citizens access to information through training and creating the necessary awareness and policy advocacy for the full implementation of the FOI regime in Liberia.</p>
 
<h5>MISSION</h5>
<p>LFIC’s mission is to strengthen the advocacy and operational capacities of civil societies to engage in policy engagement and the promotion of open governance principles and values in Liberia, and to do research on governance issues that will strengthen its advocacy roles.</p>
 
<h5>VISION</h5>
<p>The vision of the LFIC is to see empowered CSOs that will serve as strategic partners for the promotion of an effective FOI regime, and citizens are fully participating in the governance of their country, which will eventually reduce corruption/ misuse of state resources.</p>
 
<h5>OUR FUTURE AMBITION</h5>
<p>LFIC is positioning itself to become a civil society knowledge sharing and access to information hub and a credible center of policy advocacy and developing synergies with both national and international partners for the successful implementation of the FOI regime in Liberia.</p>

<h5>GOVERNING STRUCCTURE</h5>
<p>Currently, the LFIC has a Board of the nine institutional members. Its functions include developing policies that will establish an institutional framework that will enhance the capacity of the LFIC to successfully implement its programs. Full membership is institutional based and a key requirement is that these institutions should also practice LFIC focus areas within their own operational framework.</p>
 
<h5>SECRETARIAT<h5>
<p>The Secretariat runs the day-to-day activities of the LFIC. It serves as a coordinating platform for driving the various programming activities that are to be pursued in furtherance of the need to ensure the effective implantation of the FOI Law.
